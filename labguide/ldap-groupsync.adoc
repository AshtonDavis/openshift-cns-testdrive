This lab module is about using external authentication providers and LDAP is one of them. Access to resources like a project in OCP can be controlled by using authentication methods like LDAP and only the allowed privileges can be mapped to a user or a certain group.

LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. LDAP provides different levels of access to users based on their groups and privileges. 

We have defined 4 groups for this lab :-

1) ose-user                       "Users with OpenShift access"

2) ose-normal-dev                 "Normal OpenShift users"

3) ose-fancy-dev                  "Fancy OpenShift users"

4) ose-teamed-app                 "Teamed app users"

Users defined in the CloudFormation Template are as follows -
 ose-normal-dev -> normaluser1, teamuser1, teamuser2
 ose-fancy-dev -> fancyuser1, fancyuser2
 ose-teamed-app -> teamuser1, teamuser2
 ose-user -> normaluser1, teamuser1, teamuser2, fancyuser1, fancyuser2


Step-1] Check the master-config.yaml file :

After SSH-ing into the master host, go into the root mode -
 $ sudo -i


 # cat /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml
 
 
Contents will look like -
[literal]
oauthConfig:
  assetPublicURL: https://openshift.unset.ocp-admin.aws.openshifttestdrive.com/console/
  grantConfig:
    method: auto
  identityProviders:
  - challenge: true
    login: true
    mappingMethod: claim
    name: idm
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      attributes:
        email:
        - mail
        id:
        - dn
        name:
        - cn
        preferredUsername:
        - uid
      bindDN: uid=admin,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=unset,dc=ocp-admin,dc=aws,dc=openshifttestdrive,dc=com
      bindPassword: ldapadmin
      ca: /etc/origin/master/ipa-ca.crt
      insecure: false
      kind: LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider
      url: ldap://idm.unset.ocp-admin.aws.openshifttestdrive.com/cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=unset,dc=ocp-admin,dc=aws,dc=openshifttestdrive,dc=com?uid?sub?(memberOf=cn=ose-user,cn=groups,cn=accounts,dc=unset,dc=ocp-admin,dc=aws,dc=openshifttestdrive,dc=com)
  masterCA: ca-bundle.crt
  masterPublicURL: https://openshift.unset.ocp-admin.aws.openshifttestdrive.com
  masterURL: https://ip-10-0-1-200.ec2.internal

Some notable fields under 'identityProviders:' are their meanings are -
i) challenge:true -> When true, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the CLI) are sent a WWW-Authenticate challenge header for this provider.
ii) login:true -> When true, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
iii)  mappingMethod: claim -> 

Step-2 ] Make LDAP config file for group sync. This file is already configured and present in your master host. 
View the contents of the file by typing this command -

 # cat /home/cloud-user/groupsync.yaml


Step-3] Map and sync LDAP groups :
Run the command for LDAP groups sync to create the groups listed earlier in the master host -

 # oc adm groups sync --sync-config=/home/cloud-user/groupsync.yaml --confirm
 
The output will list down the four groups.

Step-4] Change group policy :
Changing policy of the group - 'ose-teamed-app' to 'cluster-admin' so that 'teamuser1' user can now create projects.
Change the policy by using this command -

 # oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin ose-teamed-app

Step-5] Create projects : 

Login as 'teamuser1' with the password 'openshift' to create projects as it would have admin rights.
[literal]
$ oc login -u teamuser1 -p openshift

Use the following commands to create 3 projects named 'app-dev', 'app-test'  and 'app-prod' -
[literal]
$ oc adm new-project app-dev --display-name="Application Development"
$ oc adm new-project app-test --display-name="Application Testing"
$ oc adm new-project app-prod --display-name="Application Production"

Step-6] Map groups to projects :

In this step we will give admin rights to certain groups so that the users associated with these groups can have 'admin' rights to the projects.
Use the following command to grant group 'ose-teamed-app' admin rights in the app-dev project -
[literal]
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group admin ose-teamed-app -n app-dev

Use the following command to grant group 'ose-teamed-app' admin rights in the app-test project -
[literal]
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group admin ose-teamed-app -n app-test

Use the follwing command to grant group 'ose-fancy-dev' admin rights in the app-prod project -
[literal]
$ oc adm policy add-role-to-group admin ose-fancy-dev -n app-prod

Now, the users of groups ose-teamed-app will have admin rights on the projects 'app-dev' and 'app-test', whereas users of group ose-fancy-dev will have admin rights on the project 'app-prod'.

Step-7] Test access to a project for an externally defined user:
This step will show that 'teamuser2' can list down the projects created and 'fancyuser1' can list down projects created by 'ose-fancy-dev' group.

Commands for logging in as the above mentioned users would be -
[literal] 
$ oc login -u teamuser2 -p openshift
$ oc login -u fancyuser1 -p openshift
