Overview
--------
While the Test Drive is designed to be an experience that is linear in nature,
it is possible to skip modules. Skipping modules requires that you perform
certain automation tasks that will actually "do" the exercise for you.

For example, if you wanted to skip user and group configuration, later labs
still rely on this being completed, so you must still make sure the steps have
been executed.

We provide automation of each module using Ansible playbooks that are located in
the `{{ REPO_LOCATION }}/tests` folder.
