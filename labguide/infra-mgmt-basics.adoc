## Infrastructure Management, Metrics and Logging
In this lab you are introduced to some basic management concepts of the
OpenShift Container Platform. This is largely driven by automation through
openshift-ansible which makes operations easy and predictable. + By the end of
this module you should have your cluster extended by another 3 nodes, deployed
logging and metrics facilities put 1 node briefly put into maintenance.

### Extending the cluster

Log in as cluster administrator (it will not matter if you are `root` or not):

[source]
----
oc login -u system:admin
----

Verify your cluster currently consists of 5 nodes, of which one is marked as _Not Schedulable_ (the Master).

[source]
----
oc get nodes
NAME                                          STATUS                     AGE
{{ INFRA_INTERNAL_FQDN }}    Ready                      1h
{{ MASTER_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   1h
{{ NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
----

Use the label specified as the default node selector for pods in the inventory
file  `/etc/ansible/hosts` to verify that your cluster currently has 3
application nodes:

[source]
----
oc get nodes -l region=apps
NAME                                          STATUS                     AGE
{{ NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
----

Extending the cluster is easy. Simply add a new set of hosts to an Ansible group
called `new_nodes` in the `openshift-ansible` installer's inventory. Then, run
the `scaleup` playbook.

#### Configure the Installer
Your environment already has 3 additional nodes, but you have not used
them so far. They are already configured in the inventory file but commented out. +
You will two several places where `#scaleup_` appears:

. in front of the `new_nodes` in the `OSEv3:children` group 
.. removing the comment tells the installer to include that subgroup. 
. in the actual `new_nodes` group, for each node's definition

When finished, your inventory file should look like the following:

[source,ini]
./etc/ansible/hosts
----
[OSEv3:children]
masters
nodes
etcd
new_nodes

...

[new_nodes]
{{ NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN }} openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'apps'}" openshift_hostname={{ NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN }} openshift_public_hostname={{ NODE4_EXTERNAL_FQDN }}
{{ NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN }} openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'apps'}" openshift_hostname={{ NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN }} openshift_public_hostname={{ NODE5_EXTERNAL_FQDN }}
{{ NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN }} openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'apps'}" openshift_hostname={{ NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN }} openshift_public_hostname={{ NODE6_EXTERNAL_FQDN }}

...

----

Now that these hosts are properly defined (uncommented), you can use Ansible to
verify that they are, in fact, online:

[source]
----
ansible new_nodes -m ping
{{ NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN }} | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
{{ NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN }} | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
{{ NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN }} | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

Much like when you installed OpenShift originally, these new hosts have all of
the
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/install_config/install/prerequisites.html[prerequisites]
already taken care of.

#### Run the Playbook to Extend the Cluster
To extend your cluster run the following playbook:

[source]
----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-node/scaleup.yml
----

The playbook takes 1-2 minutes to complete. When done verify the amount of
application nodes known to OpenShift has been increased from 3 to 6:

[source]
----
oc get nodes -l region=apps
NAME                                          STATUS                     AGE
{{ NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1m
{{ NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1m
{{ NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1m
----

TIP: When deploying a highly-available multi-master OpenShift environment, it is
also possible to add new master nodes. There is a similar playbook to run. For
more information on multi-master and HA setups, please refer to the 

### OpenShift Metrics
_Metrics_ in OpenShift refers to the continuous collection of performance and
utilization data of pods in the cluster. It allows for centralized monitoring in
the OpenShift UI and automated horizontal scaling of pods based on utilization.

The metrics implementation is based on http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular], a
metrics collection system running on OpenShift persisting data in a Cassandra
database.

In your environment metrics is not yet deployed. Configuration is done by
customizing the Ansible inventory file `/etc/ansible/hosts` and deployment is
facilitated by running a specific playbook that is part of the
`openshift-ansible` installer. You could have chosen to install the metrics
solution when the cluster was initially installed.

#### Configure the Installer
Using your favorite editor, open the `/etc/ansible/hosts` file. In the
`[OSEv3:vars]` section, you will find some directives that begin with
`openshift_metrics`. Several are commented out, with the prefix `#metrics_`
(similar to the comments used for extending the cluster).

`openshift_metrics_install_metrics=false` tells the installer *not* to install
the metrics solution when it runs. Make sure that you delete that line. Then,
remove all of the comments, so that the section in your file looks like the
following:

[source,ini]
./etc/ansible/hosts
----
...
[OSEv3:vars]
...
openshift_metrics_install_metrics=true
openshift_metrics_cassandra_storage_type=pv
openshift_metrics_cassandra_pvc_size=10Gi
openshift_metrics_cassanda_pvc_storage_class_name={{ CNS_STORAGECLASS }}
openshift_metrics_hawkular_hostname=metrics.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX }}
...
----

#### Install Metrics
There is a specific playbook included with the installer that will handle metrics. It can
be run like so:

[source]
----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/openshift-metrics.yml
----

This will deploy the metric collection and visualization stack on OpenShift. All
resources will be stood up in the `openshift-infra` *Project*. As part of the
deployment, persistent storage will automatically used for storing the metrics
information.

[WARNING]
====
In this environment you will end up using CNS as the persistent storage for the
Cassandra database. While functional, at this time CNS is not a fully supported
back-end storage solution for Cassandra. Full support for the metrics solution
on CNS should come in a future release.
====

Once the installation playbook has completed, you can then verify that the
metrics components are running in the `openshift-infra` *Project*:

[source]
----
oc login -u system:admin -n openshift-infra
oc get pods -o wide
NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP           NODE
hawkular-cassandra-1-6gv0d   1/1       Running   0          3m        10.129.0.7   node02.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com
hawkular-metrics-zkp0h       1/1       Running   0          3m        10.130.0.8   node03.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com
heapster-r2l2v               1/1       Running   0          3m        10.131.2.2   node05.internal.aws.testdrive.openshift.com
----

[NOTE]
====
In this lab environment it can take up to 2-3 minutes after the metrics playbook
finishes for the metrics stack to finish intialization and for all pods to reach
the _Ready_ state.
====

In the `NODE` column you will notice that the *Pods* for metrics are distributed
throughout the environment. As we discussed `nodeSelectors` in the app
management exercises, it may be desireable to force the metrics components to
run on specific *Nodes* in the cluster that user workload cannot run on. The
configuration options for metrics support this, and those options look like the
following:

[source]
----
openshift_metrics_hawkular_nodeselector={"region":"infra"}
openshift_metrics_cassandra_nodeselector={"region":"infra"}
openshift_metrics_heapster_nodeselector={"region":"infra"}
----

#### Explore the Metrics UI
If you don't have it open, return to the OpenShift web console:

*link:{{ WEB_CONSOLE_URL }}[]*

You will want to be sure you are logged in as _fancyuser1_, who is a
`cluster-reader` and can see interesting *Projects*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
At this point the OpenShift UI will display an error message, stating
that the metrics URL could not be reached:

image:openshift-metrics-url-error.png[] 

This is because OpenShift generated a self-signed certificate for the Hawkular
API. Go ahead and click the metrics URL https://metrics.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX }}/ 
to access Hawkular and accept the untrusted certificate. Then, return to the
OpenShift web console and refresh the page, and the metrics should begin to
display.

When working properly, it looks like this:

.The OpenShift UI will show history metrics for applications
image::openshift-metrics-overview.png[]

In the context of a specific *Pod*, the _Metrics_ tab in the UI will show CPU,
memory and network throughput for this particular *Pod* with a configurable
time-range. Also optionally a _donut_ chart next to a resource appears if the
pods was given a consumption limit on this resource (e.g. RAM).

image::openshift-metrics-pods.png[]

If you want to see interesting metrics, explore the *Project* for metrics
itself, `openshift-infra`.

### OpenShift Logging
Equally important to performance metrics is collecting and aggregating logs from
the environments and the application pods it is running. OpenShift ships with an
elastic log aggregation solution: *EFK*. + **E**lasticSearch, **F**luentd and
**K**ibana forms a configuration where logs from all nodes and applications are
consolidated (Fluentd) in a central place (ElasticSearch) on top of which rich
queries can be made from a single UI (Kibana). Administrators can see and search
through all logs, application owners and developers can allow access logs that
belong to their projects. + Like metrics the EFK stack runs on top of OpenShift.

#### Configuring the Inventory
To configure the installation of EFK edit (update or insert) the Ansible
inventory file just like you did for metrics. In the `/etc/ansible/hosts` file,
make the following changes:

* remove the line `openshift_hosted_logging_deploy=false`
* remove the comments beginning with `#logging_`

Your resulting file should look like the following:

[source,ini]
./etc/ansible/hosts
----

...

[OSEv3:vars]
...
openshift_logging_install_logging=true
openshift_logging_namespace=logging
openshift_logging_es_pvc_size=10Gi
openshift_logging_kibana_hostname=kibana.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX }}
openshift_logging_public_master_url=https://kibana.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX }}
...
----

#### Install Logging
With these settings in place executing the `openshift-logging` Ansible playbook
that ships as part of the `openshift-ansible` installer:

[source]
----
ansible-playbook /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/openshift-cluster/openshift-logging.yml
----

Once the installation finishes, log in as the cluster administrator, using the
`logging` *Project*:

[source]
----
oc login -u system:admin -n logging
----

Verify the logging stack components are up and running:

[source]
----
oc get pods -o wide

----

The _Fluentd_ *Pods* are deployed as part of a *DaemonSet*, which is a mechanism
to ensure that specific *Pods* run on specific *Nodes* in the cluster at all
times:

[source]
----
oc get daemonset
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     NODE-SELECTOR                AGE
logging-fluentd   5         5         5         logging-infra-fluentd=true   9m
----

To reach the _Kibana_ user interface, first determine its public access URL by
querying the *Route* that got set up to expose Kibana's *Service*:

[source]
----
oc get route/logging-kibana
NAME             HOST/PORT                                              PATH      SERVICES         PORT      TERMINATION          WILDCARD
logging-kibana   kibana.apps.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX }}             logging-kibana   <all>     reencrypt/Redirect   None
----

You can click the link ( https://kibana.{{ OCP_ROUTING_SUFFIX }} ) to open the
Kibana interface. There is a special authentication proxy that is configured as
part of the EFK installation that results in Kibana requiring OpenShift
credentials for access. You should login to Kibana as the `fancyuser1` user to
be able to see all of the cluster's logs. Kibana utilizes the same RBAC
underpinning OpenShift to ensure that users can only see the logs they should
have access to.

## Node maintenance

It is possible to put any node of the OpenShift environment into maintenance by marking it as non-schedulable following by _evacuation_ of all pods on the node.

These operations require elevated privileges. Ensure you are logged in as cluster admin:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oc login -u system:admin

You will see by now that there are pods running on almost all of your nodes:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

When a node needs to undergo maintenance like replacing degraded hardware components or updating packages you can temporarily remove it from OpenShift like so:

Mark node `{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}` as non-schedulable to prevent the schedulers in the system to place any new workloads on it:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oadm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --schedulable=false

Confirm the nodes is marked as non-schedulable:
----
[cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oc get nodes
NAME                                          STATUS                     AGE
{{ INFRA_INTERNAL_FQDN }}    Ready                      1h
{{ MASTER_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   1h
{{ NODE1_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready,SchedulingDisabled                      1h
{{ NODE3_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      1h
{{ NODE4_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      15m
{{ NODE5_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      15m
{{ NODE6_INTERNAL_FQDN }}   Ready                      15m
----

Marking the node out like this did not impact the pods it is running. List those pods:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oadm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --list-pods

Depending on previous actions this node will run at least the pods associated with logging and Container-native Storage but also application pods.

The next step is to evacuate the pods to other nodes in the cluster. You can first simulate what actions the system would perform during evacuation with the following command:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oadm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --evacuate --dry-run

IMPORTANT: As the command output indicates, pods running on the node as part of a `DaemonSet` like those associated to Logging, Metrics or CNS would *not* be evacuated. They will not be accessible anymore through OpenShift but simply continue to run as docker containers on the nodes until the local OpenShift services are stopped or the node is shutdown. +
This is not a problem since software like CNS or the OpenShift Metrics stack is designed to handle such situations transparently.

Start the evacuation process like this:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oadm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --evacuate

After a few moments, all of the pods, except the fluentd and glusterfs-pods, previously running on `{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}` should have terminated and new copies are restarted elsewhere.

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oc get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

This has put `{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}` into a state where an administrator can start maintenance operations. If those include a reboot of the system or upgrading the OpenShift services (`atomic-openshift-node`) the pods associated CNS, Logging and Metrics would come backup automatically up system/service restart. +
The system is still in non-schedulable though. Let's fix that.

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oadm manage-node {{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }} --schedulable=true

With this the node will be ready again to accept newly scheduled workloads. Confirm one last time the node is in _Ready_ state:

  [cloud-user@{{MASTER_HOSTNAME}} ~]$ oc get node/{{ NODE2_INTERNAL_FQDN }}

## Manipulating multi-tenant networking
